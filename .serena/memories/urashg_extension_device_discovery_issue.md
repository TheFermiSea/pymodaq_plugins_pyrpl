The URASHG Microscopy Extension is failing to initialize because it cannot find the required hardware devices. The `discover_devices` method in `URASHGDeviceManager` is unable to find the camera, power meter, and Elliptec modules in the PyMoDAQ dashboard's `modules_manager`. The likely cause is either that the plugins are not being loaded correctly by PyMoDAQ, or that the `discover_devices` method is being called before the dashboard has finished loading the plugins. To debug this, add logging to the `discover_devices` method to print the contents of `self.modules_manager.move_modules` and `self.modules_manager.viewer_modules`.
