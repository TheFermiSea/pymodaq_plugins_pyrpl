### `old_docs/`
Previously archived documentation (pre-existing):
- Various older hardware test reports and documentation

## Why Archive?

These documents are archived to:
1. **Reduce clutter** - Keep the main repository focused on current documentation
2. **Preserve history** - Maintain a record of development decisions and progress
3. **Enable recovery** - Allow future developers to understand how features evolved
4. **Provide context** - Offer insights into why certain architectural decisions were made

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, see:
- **Root directory**: `README.md`, `QUICK_START.md`, `COMMAND_MULTIPLEXING_SUMMARY.md`
- **docs/ directory**: Technical documentation, architecture guides, tutorials

## Accessing Archived Documents

All archived documents remain in version control and can be:
- Viewed directly in this archive directory
- Referenced in git history
- Retrieved if needed for current development

## Archive Policy

Documents are archived when they:
- Are superseded by newer documentation
- Represent completed milestones (no longer in active development)
- Contain historical context that may be useful but isn't needed daily
- Are development artifacts (progress reports, interim test results)

**Note**: Nothing is ever deleted - if it was valuable enough to create, it's valuable enough to preserve.
