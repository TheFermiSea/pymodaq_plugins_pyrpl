# ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED DOCUMENTATION

**WARNING**: This directory contains **OBSOLETE** documentation that should NOT be used for current development.

---

## üö´ **Do Not Use These Files**

All files in this directory are from previous development phases and contain:
- ‚ùå Outdated architectural decisions
- ‚ùå Superseded implementation plans
- ‚ùå Obsolete status reports
- ‚ùå Deprecated approaches that were abandoned

---

## ‚úÖ **Current Documentation (Use These Instead)**

For up-to-date information, see the **ROOT DIRECTORY**:

- **README.md** - Main repository documentation
- **PHASED_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md** - Current three-phase development plan
- **MULTI_MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Current architecture (if it exists)

---

## üìÇ **What's In This Directory**

### **Root-Level Deprecated Files**:
- ARCHITECTURE_REVISION.md
- COMMAND_MULTIPLEXING_SUMMARY.md
- DOCUMENTATION_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md
- FINAL_TEST_SUMMARY.md
- HANDOFF_SUMMARY.md
- PR_DESCRIPTION.md
- PYRPL_WORKER_SAFEGUARDS.md
- QUICK_START.md
- SSH_CONNECTION_FIX.md
- TCPIP_ARCHITECTURE.md
- TCP_MIGRATION_STATUS.md
- TEST_CONSTRUCTION.md
- URGENT_FIX_NEEDED.md

### **archive/ Directory**:
Contains historical documentation from earlier development phases:
- context/ - Integration context documents
- design_docs/ - Old design documents
- implementation_docs/ - Old implementation notes
- obsolete/ - Previously marked as obsolete
- old_docs/ - Earlier documentation
- research/ - Research documents (including old Gemini analysis from January 2025)
- test_reports/ - Old test reports

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Why These Were Deprecated**

**Reason**: These files were causing confusion during development because they:
1. Contained **outdated information** that conflicted with current plans
2. Included **abandoned approaches** (e.g., old IPC designs)
3. Referenced **superseded architectures**
4. Mixed **historical context** with current development

**To avoid future miscommunication**, all deprecated documentation has been moved here.

---

## üîç **If You Need Historical Context**

These files are preserved for historical reference only. If you need to understand:
- Why certain decisions were made
- What was tried and abandoned
- Historical development timeline
- Old test results

Then you can browse this directory, BUT always verify against current documentation first.

---

## üìÖ **Deprecation Date**

**Date**: 2025-10-01  
**Reason**: Clean up to prevent confusion during Phase 1 development

---

**‚ö†Ô∏è REMEMBER: For current development, ALWAYS use the documentation in the root directory!**
