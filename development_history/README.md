## Documentation
- `FINAL_HARDWARE_SUCCESS_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive documentation of hardware testing success

## Historical Context
These files were created during the successful resolution of PyRPL compatibility issues and Red Pitaya hardware connection establishment in August 2025. The final configuration achieved:

- Red Pitaya IP: 192.168.1.150
- PyRPL hardware connection: SUCCESSFUL
- All compatibility issues resolved
- Complete plugin suite ready for hardware operation

## Current Status
The main repository now contains only the production-ready plugin code, with these development artifacts preserved for reference.
