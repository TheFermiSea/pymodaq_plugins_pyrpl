# PyMoDAQ PyRPL Plugins - Hardware Testing Status Report

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Hardware:** Red Pitaya STEMlab at 100.107.106.75
**Plugin Version:** 0.1.dev178+g36ca90df7

## Executive Summary

Hardware testing has been initiated with the real Red Pitaya device. The **architectural fix (static params pattern) has been successfully validated** - plugins load without config file I/O and successfully establish hardware connections. However, a pyrpl/stemlab API compatibility issue is blocking data acquisition for the Scope plugin.

## Test Environment Status

### ✅ Environment Validation - PASSED

All environment tests passed successfully:

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Red Pitaya Connectivity | ✓ PASS | SSH port 22 reachable at 100.107.106.75 |
| PyMoDAQ Installation | ✓ PASS | Version 5.0.18 installed and importable |
| PyRPL Library Availability | ✓ PASS | stemlab (headless fork) available |
| Plugin Imports | ✓ PASS | All plugins import without config file I/O |
| Static Params Verification | ✓ PASS | Hardcoded hostname 100.107.106.75 confirmed |

**Conclusion:** Environment is READY for hardware testing.

## Scope Plugin Hardware Testing

### Test Results Summary

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Plugin Initialization | ✓ PASS | DAQ_1DViewer_PyRPL_Scope instantiates correctly |
| Hardware Connection | ✓ PASS | Successfully connects to Red Pitaya 100.107.106.75 |
| Data Acquisition | ✗ FAIL | pyrpl curve() returns "Result is not set" |
| Parameter Changes | ✓ PASS | Parameters can be modified |
| Graceful Shutdown | ✓ PASS | Plugin closes cleanly |

### Critical Finding: Architectural Fix VALIDATED

**The architectural fix is working correctly with real hardware:**

1. ✅ Plugins load without triggering config file I/O
2. ✅ Hardcoded hostname (100.107.106.75) is used successfully
3. ✅ Hardware connection establishes using static params
4. ✅ PyRPLManager and PyRPLConnection work as designed

**Connection Log Evidence:**
```
INFO: Successfully connected to Red Pitaya 100.107.106.75
INFO: Connected to Red Pitaya 100.107.106.75 (pymodaq_scope)
INFO: PASS: Successfully connected to Red Pitaya hardware
```

### Data Acquisition Issue

**Error:** `Failed to acquire scope data: 'Result is not set.'`

**Root Cause:** pyrpl/stemlab API compatibility issue

**Technical Details:**
- pyrpl's `scope.curve(timeout)` method returns a Future object
- The Future's `await_result(timeout)` raises "Result is not set"
- This suggests trigger/acquisition flow differs from expected pyrpl API
- The scope configuration appears correct (trigger_source: immediately, decimation: 1024)

**Bugs Fixed During Testing:**
1. ✅ Fixed lazy import of pyrpl - was being checked before being called
2. ✅ Fixed scope.trigger() call - replaced with scope.curve() as per pyrpl API

**Remaining Issue:**
- Need to investigate correct pyrpl scope acquisition sequence
- May require additional initialization or different timeout handling
- Possible stemlab vs pyrpl API differences

## Code Fixes Applied

### 1. PyRPL Lazy Import Fix (pyrpl_wrapper.py:489-495)

**Before:**
```python
# Check if PyRPL is available
if not PYRPL_AVAILABLE or pyrpl is None:
    error_msg = "PyRPL is not available - cannot establish connection"
    logger.error(error_msg)
    return False
```

**After:**
```python
# Lazy import PyRPL if not already done
if not _lazy_import_pyrpl():
    error_msg = "PyRPL is not available - cannot establish connection"
    logger.error(error_msg)
    return False
```

**Impact:** Hardware connection now works ✓

### 2. Scope Acquisition API Fix (pyrpl_wrapper.py:1185-1186)

**Before:**
```python
scope.trigger()
while not scope.stopped():
    ...
voltage_data = scope.curve()
```

**After:**
```python
# Acquire data (curve() handles trigger and wait internally)
voltage_data = scope.curve(timeout=acq_timeout)
```

**Impact:** Eliminated AttributeError for missing trigger() method

### 3. Environment Validation Test Fixes (test_environment.py)

**Fixed Imports:**
- Changed `DataActuator` → `DataRaw` (PyMoDAQ 5.x API)
- Changed `DAQ_1Dviewer_PyRPL_Scope` → `DAQ_1DViewer_PyRPL_Scope` (correct class name)

**Impact:** All environment tests now pass ✓

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Debug Scope Data Acquisition** (In Progress)
   - Investigate pyrpl scope trigger/acquisition flow
   - Check stemlab vs pyrpl API differences
   - Test alternative acquisition methods

2. **Test ASG Plugin** (Next)
   - Hardware connection test
   - Waveform generation test
   - Parameter modification test

3. **Test PID Plugin**
   - Hardware connection test
   - PID control loop test
   - Setpoint/parameter test

4. **Mock Mode Testing**
   - Verify all plugins work without hardware
   - Test fallback behavior

### Outstanding Questions

1. Does stemlab have different scope acquisition API than original pyrpl?
2. Is there additional scope initialization required before curve()?
3. Should we use rolling_mode or different trigger settings?

## Hardware Test Files Created

- `/tests/hardware/__init__.py` - Package marker
- `/tests/hardware/test_environment.py` - Environment validation (ALL TESTS PASS ✓)
- `/tests/hardware/test_scope_hardware.py` - Scope plugin testing (CONNECTION WORKS ✓)

## Verdict So Far

### What Works ✓

1. Static params architectural pattern
2. Hardware connection establishment
3. Plugin initialization without config I/O
4. PyRPL/stemlab integration architecture
5. Connection management and lifecycle

### What Needs Work ✗

1. Scope data acquisition API compatibility
2. Possible timeout handling improvements
3. Cleanup of Pyrpl.close() method (currently doesn't exist)

### Architectural Fix Status: **VALIDATED**

The core architectural change (static params, no config I/O at import) has been **successfully tested with real hardware** and works correctly. The remaining issues are pyrpl API compatibility problems, not architectural flaws.

## Recommendations

1. **Continue Hardware Testing**: Test ASG and PID plugins to get complete picture
2. **Investigate pyrpl Documentation**: Research correct scope.curve() usage pattern
3. **Consider Alternative Approaches**: May need to use scope_async or different trigger setup
4. **Document pyrpl Compatibility**: Create compatibility notes for stemlab fork differences
