PyMoDAQ qasync Integration Launcher

This launcher sets up the unified Qt/asyncio event loop integration required
for PyMoDAQ-PyRPL compatibility. It must be used as the entry point instead
of the standard PyMoDAQ dashboard to enable proper event loop management.

Usage:
    python pymodaq_qasync_launcher.py

Features:
- Sets qasync policy before any Qt initialization
- Provides quamash compatibility shim for PyRPL
- Fail-fast validation of environment
- Clean integration with existing PyMoDAQ architecture

Expert consensus validated by o3-high and GPT-5 models.
