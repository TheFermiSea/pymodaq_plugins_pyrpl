The `launch_urashg_minimal.py` script sets `self.modules_manager` to `None` in its `HybridDashboard` class to bypass a bug in PyMoDAQ 5.1.0a0. However, the `discover_devices` method in `URASHGDeviceManager` does not handle the case where `self.modules_manager` is `None`, leading to a `AttributeError`. The `discover_devices` method should be modified to check if `self.modules_manager` is `None` before trying to access its attributes.
