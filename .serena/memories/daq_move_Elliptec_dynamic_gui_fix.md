The `daq_move_Elliptec.py` plugin was updated to dynamically generate the GUI elements (home buttons and position readouts) based on the `mount_addresses` parameter. This was done by clearing the existing children of the `actions_group` and `status_group` in the `_update_ui_from_settings` method before adding the new ones. The `commit_settings` method was also updated to handle the dynamically generated buttons.
